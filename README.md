# Wrestlemania-Java-App

*2nd year OO module group project*

## Contents

This repo contains a group project from 2nd year for our object oriented programming module. The application we chose to create allowed users to add new wrestlers, edit or delete existing wrestlers, and select and compare wrestler stats to determine who the winner would likely be.


Marking criteria for this project required the application to:
* be capable of CRUD
* make use of images and icons
* save to and load from files
* make use of inheritance and abstraction
